        Over the last few years, the music industry has tried to take the time to make room for artists of color. However, this public push for diversity doesn't often trickle down to smaller, underground artists.
        <i>The "Problem" With Diversity</i> is a short documentary that provides these artists with a platform to voice their concerns on this issue. The goal of this documentary was to shine a light on the true issue with this
        public push for diversity in the music industry and how isn't eactly what the media has made it out to be. In the film, we speak to Regina Cheim, student and up-and-coming singer/songwriter about her struggles with coming up 
        as an Asian American in the music industry. We follow Regina's story from her interactions with representation from her childhood to present day and how that has reflected in her motivations to continue her path in music. We then follow
        Yonkers rapper, Iman Nunez and his journey. This story takes a different approach, as Iman speaks from the perspective of a seasoned independent artist, performing shows on his own as well as opening up for 21 Savage. While both perspectives
        hold very different origins, the "Problem" remains the same. The music industry wasn't made for people of color, and because of this, they must do everything in their power to get to the top.
