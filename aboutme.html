            <p>
            My name is Makayla Fredericks. I am originally from Harlem, New York but was raised in The Bronx. I am a sophomore at Fordham University in Lincoln Center. I am a double major in Journalism and Communications and Culture with a minor in Marketing.
            One of my passions is music and because of that, I plan to pursue music journalism an interview different music artists and help them tell their story. Part of how I was able to do this was through <i>The "Problem" With Diversity</i> project. This project
            taught me that there isn't just one medium you can use to tell a story. I am excited to take what I've learned from that project to further my career.
